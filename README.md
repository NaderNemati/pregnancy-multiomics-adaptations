This study includes three different parts:
Our objective is to utilize machine learning techniques to analyze the relationship between the immune system and gestational age during pregnancy. Specifically, we will employ elastic net and support vector machines as classifiers to predict gestational age based on immune system data. Additionally, we aim to develop a PyTorch neural network model to accurately predict the sex of the baby. By employing these methodologies, we can gain insights into the dynamics of the immune system throughout pregnancy and potentially identify early indicators of pregnancy-related complications such as preterm birth and preeclampsia.

The code conducts an analysis on randomly generated data (X) and corresponding responses (Y) using leave-group-out cross-validation. This process is repeated 1000 times. In each iteration, the code generates predictions, and the value of each entry in Y is the average prediction obtained across all cross-validation iterations.

The objective is to examine the relationship between regression coefficients and the correlation of features with the target data. This analysis aims to identify the significant features and understand the factors that influence them. By exploring these relationships, we can determine the important features accurately and gain insights into the underlying components that impact them.
