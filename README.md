# Pregnancy Multiomics Adaptations

Welcome to the **Pregnancy Multiomics Adaptations** repository. This project delves into the intricate interplay between the immune system and gestational age during pregnancy using advanced machine learning techniques. Our primary objectives encompass two distinct facets:

- **Gestational Age Prediction:** Leveraging the power of elastic net and support vector machines, we aim to predict gestational age based on immune system data. This prediction framework enables us to gain deeper insights into the evolving dynamics of the immune system throughout pregnancy. These insights shed light on potential early indicators of pregnancy-related complications such as preterm birth and preeclampsia.

- **Gender Prediction:** Through the robust capabilities of PyTorch neural networks, our study strives to accurately predict the gender of the baby. This aspect of our research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of pregnancy adaptations by examining gender-specific variations.

The provided code conducts a rigorous analysis on synthetically generated data (X) and corresponding responses (Y) using a leave-group-out cross-validation approach. This process is iterated 1000 times, generating predictions and aggregating results to provide a holistic perspective.

Furthermore, our investigation delves into the intricate relationship between regression coefficients and feature correlations with target data. This analysis holds the promise of uncovering significant features and unraveling the intricate factors influencing them. By peering into these connections, we aim to precisely identify pivotal features while gaining deeper insights into the underlying components that shape them.

We invite you to explore the code, methodologies, and findings presented here, contributing to the expanding field of pregnancy-related multiomics adaptations. Your engagement and collaboration are warmly welcomed as we collectively enhance our understanding of this critical domain.
